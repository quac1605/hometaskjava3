The project is a simple vehicle management system that allows users to create and manage a list of vehicles. The system supports three types of vehicles: internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs), hybrid vehicles (HEVs), and battery electric vehicles (BEVs).

The system allows users to create new vehicles, view existing vehicles, and update vehicle information. Users can also search for vehicles by manufacturer, model, year, and color.
